<h1>Services</h1>
<p>These are the software services provided on the WyseChoice network.&nbsp; Each page should use the same format to describe the server and application information.&nbsp; Sections should use standard anchor names so that they can be referenced by other pages on the network.</p>
<ul>
  <li>xWiki</li>
  <li>Portainer</li>
  <li>pgAdmin4</li>
  <li>Ghini</li>
  <li>Grafana</li>
  <li>Pi-Hole</li>
</ul>
<h2>Email</h2>
<p>Email addresses: chris.wyse@wysechoice.net, doris.wyse@wysechoice.net</p>
<p>The following flow diagram describes the Email configuration. &nbsp;It uses three separate services - Cloudflare, ImproveMX, and Cox. &nbsp;When an Email is sent from anywhere on the internet, the DNS service on Cloudflare for the wysechoice.net domain recognizes the Email address and forwards it to ImproveMX. &nbsp;Cloudflare supports forwarding to a single Email address. &nbsp;ImproveMX provides Email forwarding for multiple Email addresses in a domain. &nbsp;The Email is forwarded to one of two servers on ImproveMX, which determine the final destination address and server at cox.net. &nbsp;Changing Email service providers only requires modification of the ImproveMX records to point to the new servers. &nbsp;The wysechoice.net Email addresses remain unchanged, regardless of provider.</p>
