# LastPass Information
We currently have two LastPass accounts - chris.wyse@wysechoice.net and doris.wyse@choice.net.  All joint accounts with access required by both of us will be stored in a shared folder - 'Shared - Wyse'.

To avoid logging in to both accounts the LastPass extension on the WyseChoice computer (Mark's room) will by configured on Chrome for Doris, and Firefox for Chris.  All personal passwords for Doris should be stored using Chrome, but in a non-shared folder.

## Password Recovery
Each LastPass account master password will be maintained inside of one of the two accounts.  If Doris loses her password, she can recover it from my account and vise versa.  The passwords will be stored with the following encoding:

## Future plans
Create a third account for extra secure account for bank and critical information.  We would never be logged into this account except while accessing information.  If we need to stay logged into an account, it will be one of the other two accounts.
