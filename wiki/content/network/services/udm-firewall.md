# UDM Firewall Service

Documents firewall behavior on the UniFi Dream Machine.

## Role
- Inter-VLAN isolation
- WAN ingress filtering
- Guest network enforcement
- DNS policy-based routing

## Implementation
- Managed via **iptables**
- Rules dynamically generated by UniFi OS
- User rules injected via UBIOS chains

## Inspection Commands
```bash
iptables-save
iptables -L -v -n
```

## Design Notes
- Do not persist manual rules directly
- Firewall rules should be documented, not edited in-place

## Cross-links
- [UDM DHCP](./udm-dhcp.md)
- [UDM DNS](./udm-dns.md)
